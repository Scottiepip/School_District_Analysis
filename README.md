# School_District_Analysis
Analyse school district data to uncover schools' performance based on different aspects.
## Overview of Project
Maria, the Chief Data Scientist of City School District, is responsible for analyzing information from variety of sources and variety of formats. She is tasked to preparing all standardized test data for analysis,reporting and presentation to privde insights about performance trends and patterns. These insights are used to inform discussions and strategic decisions at the school district level. Maria asked us to help her analyze data on student funding and students' standardized score to aggregate the data and showcase trends in school performance.

However, after we done the analyze, The school board has notified Maria and her supervisor that the students_complete.csv file shows evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. Although the school board does not know the full extent of the academic dishonesty, they want to uphold state-testing standards and have turned to Maria for help. Maria has asked us to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. And Maria want us to repeat the school district analysis that we did and write up a report to describe how these changes affected the overall analysis.

      Baes on the two pictures shown above, we can see that after we removed the math score and reading score for 9th graders from Thomas High School, there's a small decline, less than 1% on all the results.
